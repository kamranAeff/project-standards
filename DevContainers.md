# DevContainers

Visual Studio Code (as of from version 1.35) introduced an exciting set of extensions for remote development. I highly recommend to install [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension pack, it'll install below extensions for you;

* [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) : Work with a sandboxed toolchain or container-based application by opening any folder mounted into or inside a container.

* [Remote - SSH](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/ssh) : Work with source code in any location by opening folders on a remote machine/VM using SSH. Supports x86_64 and ARMv7l (AArch32) glibc-based Linux hosts. VS Code Insiders also supports ARMv8l (AArch64) glibc-based Linux hosts.

* [Remote - WSL](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/wsl) : Get a Linux-powered development experience from the comfort of Windows by opening any folder in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
