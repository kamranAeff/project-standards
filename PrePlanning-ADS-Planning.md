# Starting a new project

It's important to start a new project with a solid foundation.

We can use this document as a _guideline_ or _checklist_ to make sure that every _important_ steps are taken and nothing is forgotten.

## Pre Planning

Most probably, team members already have each other's names before pre-planning.

Also, team members might started working together, remotely.

The following steps are the guideline for _first_ on-site meeting.

‚òê Quick introduction of the team members

Each team member will introduce himself/herself to the rest of the team with mentioning
  * His/her name
  * Where he/she is based
  * Primary focus areas
  * Expected role in the project

‚òê Present list of the team members on screen and update if needed (_if the role has been changed, the name written incorrectly, etc_)

‚òê Present previous steps and what's ahead

  * Envisioning
  * Past Sprint dates
  * Current
  * Upcoming Sprints
  * Finishing date

‚òê Ask for filling availabilities on Azure DevOps

Go to Sprints ‚Üí Capacity and fill availabilities in there

‚òê Discuss Timeline and closure date of the project

‚òê Talk about, technical requirements and knowledge (for example, _Python knowledge is a big plus_, _we can do close-pair-programming in the first sprint to make sure everyone is familiar with tooling and language_, etc.)

‚òê Present Team Working Agreement (Office hours, Meetings, Standups, etc.)

  * Discuss and Agree on having Daily Standups (for example, _09:30 ü°ò 09:45 CET_)
  * Discuss and Agree on having Demos, Retrospectives and Planning sessions weekle (for example, _on Wednesdays_)
  * Discuss and Agree on having at-least 1 reviewer from the customer on each PR to improve transfer knowledge

‚òê Present Code and Project Guidelines

* Discuss and Agree on which tools will be used for development, linting and testing

* Discuss and Agree on Branching and PR conventions

‚òê Check if everyone in the team has access to Repo, Azure DevOps, Teams org and channels, etc.

‚òê Demo Time!

Quick demos related to the project (for example, _Azure ML_, _DevContainer_, _LiveShare via VS Code_, etc.)

‚òê Results of the Research Tasks shared and discussed

‚òê Discuss Personas

This exercise is for having a clear understanding of who is going to use the project and for what reasons

DevOps Engineer:

Responsible for CI/CD Pipelines, Telemetry, Automation, Efficiency

ML Engineer:

Responsible for managing ML/DS Pipelines


‚òê Discus and Agree on the Example User Story (Title, Description and Acceptance Criteria)

‚òê Discus User Stories

* Divide into sub-teams and use User Story Template to create user stories (As a ‚Ä¶ I want to ‚Ä¶ so that ‚Ä¶)

* Get together, read all the user stories and group the same ones in clusters

* Found the same user stories with different wordings and replaced them with a single user story

* Prioritize and order clusters and user stories in them

## ADS

Walk through requirements and facts (limitations that we can't change)

Start to draw the flow of the tasks

Discus the input, output and the data scheme of the tasks

Discus the pipeline and technologies we can implement such a task in the workflow

Discus the coordinator and integrator of the tasks

Discus what is in-scope and out-of-the-scope of the project, so all the team members will be on the same page about what is going to be built
